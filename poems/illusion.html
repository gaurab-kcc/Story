Ohh Imaginary person,
I've been thinking about me,
About the stars I've been counting—
Jumping high from the sky.

If I fall,
I still wear a smile,
Maybe you're thinking about me.

I fell to my bones—I'm craving.
It's a curse, and it's growing.
I need you here to stay.
Maybe one day,
I'll find you crying…
And I'll hold you,
So you won't.

I was also thinking—
No, haha,
I held my imagination.
No—it's all in the past.
The scenes… all in the past.
Now, we're apart.

Wanting to see you
Was just a feeling—
One you left me with.

I once watched you grow in a day,
And become a child again.
Your little curiosity
Was all you gave me.

Thinking aloud about us—
They told me,
I was looking for something to live for.
Believing in something
That may… never existed.

A sound constantly ringing in my head,
I see sunshine,
Looking at me from afar—
Waving… to let go.

I waited forever their,
To see.
You're hiding from me.

The music you gave me
Still rings in my head.
You're on my lips.
It feels like the apocalypse.

A haunting feeling—
Come hunt me.
Come hurt me.
I've been lonely.

The sleeping sound of music
Feels like it's fading,
And now,
Inside me… something's missing.

I've got the music on my side,
Listening,
Feeling,
Thinking about the goodbyes
I never said.

Still hoping—
To see you again.

The light I get in the morning—
That short thing you said…
It always gets me thinking:

What's on your mind?
An imaginary person?
Or a real one by your side?

It hurts to say—
But that's our goodbye.
We're just playing hide and seek.
I don't wanna play anymore.
I'm tired of this game.
Now… please let it go.

When I tried to talk,
You were always disappeared.
I've been thinking hard—
What's on your heart?
A boring person?
Or a cheerful one,
Hoping to reach you
At the end of the day?

The things you said about me…
Was that all there was?
Maybe you never told me
What you really want.

The beauty you showed
Always mesmerized me.
Your smile melted me.
Your hand—
It wanted to be held.
I wish I could've held it.

Listening to songs,
Thinking about you—
That was my whole day.

The melody in the background
Was the tune I'll always remember.
Maybe it's telling me…
To say goodbye forever.
Or maybe it says:
"Keep dreaming."

Was that what I wanted?
Or just the selfishness I created?
Seeing others talk about you—
Seeing you play around,
Was it jealousy… or just loneliness?

But in the end,
I didn't understand.
And maybe,
That's the only truth
I need to remember.

Like moonlight—
Lighting up the night.
What are you waiting for?
I'll be a toad…
Staring at the sky all night.
Hahaha…

Goodbye forever and ever —
Your stranger.
