            Ahhhhhh…

Am I sighing with a broken heart,
Without a girl?
Am I crying without tears?
Am I listening without truly hearing?
Am I blind, even with eyes open?

In a world full of the dead,
Here I am—
Talking about love. Hahaha.

Am I in love?
Or just expecting it?
Who knows.

But I know—
I’m walking toward something…
A trap?
Or maybe, just maybe—
It’s the happiness
I’ve been waiting for too long.

I see people distancing themselves—
And I don’t know why.
I tried.
But what is a desert…
Without the sand?

At the end of the day,
I’m still expecting.
Why?
What do I even seek?

Maybe attention.
Maybe a friend.
Maybe someone special.
Or maybe just…
Time alone.

Love and affection—
Hard to see.
Harder to explain.
Why?

Maybe in someone’s world,
You’re their entire world.
Maybe in someone else’s…
You don’t even exist.

Does a person really want
To be a big part of someone’s world?
Or just not be forgotten?

A day passes.
We pass.
Time passes.

What stays?
Maybe the Earth.
Maybe something else.

Who wants to be immortal
In a short world filled with sickness?

We all see the world differently—
But the world itself
Stays the same.

Some people come.
Some go.
Some stay.

But the interesting part?
The one who watches it all…
Is always the same.

Isn’t that a phase, too?
