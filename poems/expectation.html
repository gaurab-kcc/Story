            > *Expectation buries me in a deep dark sea—* 
            Others move, their shadows flicker, but my own motion’s lost it.  
            
            Standing, staring—why? No clue.  
            Maybe I’ve lost my heart somewhere.  
            Or maybe I’m still searching for it.  
            
            Expecting to learn.  
            To receive.  
            To belong.  
            To be admired.  
            To be… seen.  
            
            *Ahhh...*  
            
            The frustration inside me—  
            It grew without warning.  
            Maybe it’s already grown up,  
            While I stayed behind.  
            
            I imagine a dark place calling me—  
            A place where people are buried quietly,  
            Unnoticed.  
            And I’m just watching from a distance.  
            
            *Hahaha.*  
            
            Maybe someone can heal me.  
            Someone? Who?  
            An imaginary person  
            In an imaginary world.  
            
            Responsibilities grow heavier,  
            Draining from the inside.  
            I can’t hide.  
            I’ve only held onto one thing:  
            
            A goal to find peace.  
            To find happiness.  
            
            But what’s really there?  
            Is it a short-term joy?  
            Living in the moment?  
            Or long-term?  
            Living for a future?  
            
            Am I suffering?  
            Maybe.  
            From what? , I don’t know.  
            
            Many die , I still live.  
            But when I see the dead,  
            Why does it feel so calm?  
            
            Is it okay to leave everything behind  
            And just move on?  
            Or do we keep dragging everything with us?  
            
            A place of peace,  
            A world of nothingness.  
            
            Where do I exist?  
            What does exist?  
            Where do I go?  
            Where do I move?  
            
            Sitting beneath a wide tree,  
            Watching the sunset fall together with me…  
            
            *Hahaha.*  
            
            A perfect imaginary world.  
            Some people wish for that.  
            Am I one of them?  
            
            Still searching.  
            Still finding.  
            A place to belong.  
            
            Don’t I already have one? Yes.  
            But don’t we all want more than one?  
            Who knows?  
            
            I watch people,  
            The environment around me…  
            And I feel left out.  
            
            Like an imaginary person  
            Wandering a real world.  
            
            The silence?  
            It’s like a melody,  
            Softly humming through me.  
            
            But everything else—  
            It’s like a swarm of mosquitoes.  
            Buzzing and Moving.  
            
            When I look at girls,  
            I feel like I don’t exist.  
            When I look at boys,  
            I feel like I’m not normal.  
            When I look at my family,  
            I feel free.  
            When I look at everyone else,  
            I feel trapped.  
            
            When I look at the bigger picture…  
            I feel like an ant.
