            Confusion,
            As I never wanted to see—
            Thinking,
            Felt to never think again.
            Scenes never seemed so beautiful,
            Yet never enjoyed again.
            
            Hurt.
            Am I hurt that you didn't care?
            Am I hurt that you didn’t feel?
            Am I hurt that you didn’t see
            The feeling coming from me?
            
            It feels like a wind breeze,
            A cold stare in colder weather,
            A death that embraced me
            With a frozen hug—
            A hug I never wanted to let go.
            
            In a dimension of different worlds,
            My friend stared at me from far ago.
            Why do I sense anger in your eyes?
            Is it illusion?
            Or a misunderstanding
            I never let go?
            
            The moments I gave you together—
            Were they not enough?
            The things I gave you—
            Were they not enough?
            
            I only wanted to be a small part
            Of a world that belongs to someone.
            The sky was clear—
            But I saw darkness hiding in it.
            
            Pitch-black eyes looked at me,
            Wanting me to think and sink.
            The relaxing warmth someone gave
            Turned into a wound that won’t heal.
            
            That day I received a call—
            A voice so sweet,
            I didn’t like mine.
            
            I should’ve been ashamed—
            Because I never should have left.
            Wanting to follow, see, talk, enjoy the moments
            With someone was the thing I enjoyed.
            But was that all there was?
            
            Was that the day
            I saw two things in the same place—
            One side warm, showing love,
            The other cold, hiding anger?
            
            It wanted to devour me whole.
            But then…
            I saw a light.
            
            A light, shining like a star—
            Bright and warm,
            Yet not a place I could reach.
            So close…
            Yet so far.
            
            Admiring from a distance
            Was all I had.
            A star, surrounded by stars,
            Shining so bright—
            I felt dimmed.
            Waiting
            To be extinguished and disappear,
            Not knowing anything at all.
            
            Curiosity searched for answers
            I never had.
            Maybe deep down,
            I didn’t want them.
            Afraid the stage I built
            Would fall apart.
            
            My friend stared at me—
            Intensely,
            Maybe with a hidden rage.
            Comparison had rooted itself
            In a heart that wouldn’t let go.
            
            You tried to distract me,
            A trick you learned to hide the truth,
            With a show.
            Too bad for you,
            That was just a joke.
            
            That side glance you gave her—
            I saw it.
            A feeling I didn’t want to see.
            A flower has many bees—
            You were just one of these.
            
            As I searched for that friend inside me,
            Many misunderstood that friend
            To be something else for me.
            Maybe it was inner me.
            Or imaginary.
            
            Jealousy was never a part of me—
            But as I continued to see,
            I realized
            I did feel
            Somewhat
            Lonely.
