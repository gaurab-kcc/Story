        <div class="poem-content">
            A person being too emotional… is a way of harming oneself.
            Emotion is a feeling.
            A feeling to feel, to tell, to listen, to understand, to see.
            
            Are those the five senses we talk about?
            No.
            These are something deeper.
            
            Feeling to feel ———
            Falling in love.
            Receiving love.
            Giving love.
            Love is a form of like, respect, and admiration.
            But are those all the same? I don’t know.
            
            I admire someone…
            But admiring someone and wanting to be admired—
            That’s not the same.
            Am I the first one… or the second?
            
            Feeling to tell ————
            “Tell” means to open up. To talk.
            Who doesn’t want to talk to someone special?
            Is it necessary that it’s someone special?
            
            Aren’t we just… lonely?
            And yeah, maybe I mean a girl.
            But sharing with someone feels like relief—
            Yet sometimes that relief is also poison.
            Who do we even tell?
            An imaginary person in a dream?
            
            Feeling to listen ————
            If you can speak, you must also listen.
            A person who listens… learns.
            Learns how much someone else might be hollow.
            
            Maybe that’s just one person’s thought.
            Others might say, “This is nonsense.”
            Maybe their life is going great.
            But what defines “good” or “bad”?
            Isn’t that just… perspective?
            
            Feeling to understand ————
            We try so hard to understand others…
            But fail to understand ourselves.
            
            I do.
            I try to be a good friend. I try to get things right.
            But things don’t go right.
            
            Reality and expectation—
            They’re not like heaven and earth.
            They’re like heaven and hell.
            
            I try to talk to someone—nothing back.
            Maybe they’re busy.
            Maybe they saw it and ignored it.
            Maybe they forgot.
            Or maybe… it just don’t matter.
            Who knows.
            
            Not understanding that,
            I buried myself in silence.
            I still haven’t gotten up…
            But I’m slowly trying to find a way.
            
            Feeling to see ———
            I want to see happiness.
            But I can’t.
            Why?
            
            Is the happiness I’m looking for… mine?
            Or someone else’s?
            
            If you can’t feel or see your own happiness,
            How do you know how lucky you are?
            
            Are you?
            Haha. Maybe.
            
            Seeing others happy can make you happy too—
            But But just a flicker.
            
             The rest… maybe it’s lost in the desert of expecting too much
